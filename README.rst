NumPlot Module
===============

A python module that combines the power of python Dictionaries (see
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
and Matplotlib (see https://matplotlib.org/) for producing plots
easily with less effort.

o Dictionaries are data structures that offer convenient indexing based on 'keys' 
o Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in python that uses data passed in as arguments to plot

We extend the Dictionary class of python with several plotting
behaviors to make this work with ease to the user.
